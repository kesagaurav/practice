/*
 
 *in this example what i did is if we want to initiliaze an varibale
	we say exmaple in the class Gaurav we keep int x;
	then by sysout we pass the value let us say 10 it will be printed
	if i declare the value and call the variable let us say
	if int x=10 when we call the x in the output(sysout) it will
	give error saying that you should declare or cange the varible
	to static then i declare the class variable which is Gaurav g=new Gaurav();
	then i call System.out.println(g.x); it will give you the value of x
